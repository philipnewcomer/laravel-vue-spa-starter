# Laravel/Vue SPA Starter Template

This project is a starter template for building single page web apps with Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind.

The goal is to take a default Laravel application created by scaffolding auth functions using the Tailwind frontend preset, and to recreate equivalent functionality in a SPA.

Specifically, this project will get you off the ground with a SPA that has user registration, login, logout, forgot/reset password, and email verification pages, built in Vue and Tailwind, with a Laravel API backend.

1. Clone repo
2. `composer install`
